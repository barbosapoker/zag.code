        <h2><STRONG>HOW DOES MOOC WORKS?</STRONG></h2>
        <p>MOOCs usually have a specific start and finish date, they run a couple of times a year, and last for weeks rather than the months or years that traditional university courses do.
            During a MOOC, you’ll use a wide range of online media and interactive tools to interact with university educators and other learners. This might include video lectures, articles, discussions, assignments and social networking.
            Due to the large number of people taking MOOCs, you’ll usually get support from the community of other learners, as well as educators. And your progress on a course might be assessed through peer-reviewed written assignments or computer-marked tests, rather than by tutors.
            In short, MOOCs are free courses for lots of learners that take place completely online.
