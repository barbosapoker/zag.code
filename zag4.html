     <h2><strong>DISADVANTAGE OF MOOC</strong></h2>
     <p><br>(1) MOOC provides all the video lectures and slides along with all related reading resources. This gives the students scope for not going through the lectures gradually but whole lectures in a single day which does not lead to deep understanding of the concepts.
        <br>(2) Real time question answering is also not possible while going through the lectures.
       <br> (3) Technical courses needing physical hands-on practical exposures (eg. Civil, Mechanical, Electrical etc.) are quite tough to be delivered through MOOC.
        <br>(4) There is no opportunity for effective assessment methods like Q&A in classroom, surprise quizzes and presentations.
        <br>(5) No proper evaluation methods are there as automatic machine assessments and evaluations are not effective. Peer evaluation sometimes lead to discouragement among students which lead them to dropout from the course.
        <br>(6) MOOC style of education will gradually kill the care, empathy and respect involved between teacher and students in a physical classroom. It only increases the virtual social community.
