        <h2>ADVANTAGE OF MOOC</h2>
        <p>MOOC creates the opportunity for sharing ideas & knowledge and also helps improving lifelong learning skills by providing easy access to global resources.
           <br> (2) It improves cross cultural relationships which leads to collaboration between institution educators and learners locally and internationally.
            <br>(3) It gives an idea where I stand in the course in the current world as large number of students all over the globe would have registered for the same course on the same common platform and participate in the activities and discussion in the study group.
           <br> (4) MOOC enhances active learning. Research shows that students learn more through active learning (i.e. when they have assignments or discussion on an issue) rather than through listening to lectures. Students listen to lectures more attentively if they have been given a problem or task to solve before the lecture. In this regard the structure that most MOOCs have – short lectures alternating with assignments and quizzes – seems to be ideal. Of course, one could also do this in a classroom, but it would be more difficult to ensure that all students participate: some might need longer to assimilate the content of the lecture, and prefer to listen to it again before doing the assignment [2]. Peer-to-peer contact facilitated by MOOC can also trigger effective active learning.
           <br> (5) MOOC encourages flipping the classroom. Teacher-student contact time usually used for lectures could be used differently, e.g. for discussions, experiments, project and group-work, working with peers etc. Students watch lectures online at home and interact with faculty regarding their doubts while in class. It has been strongly advocated and demonstrated by Salman Khan, founder of the Khan Academy, in the context of school teaching. Teachers get time to work with students on an individual basis.
           <br> (6) Knowledge sharing in Discussion Forum helps reflective and global learners along with active and sequential learners. Reflective learners who are not able to share ideas inside the physical classroom can put their ideas in discussion forum ad get the view points of others. Global learners who feel themselves lost in the beginning can share their diverse ideas on the forum and can get other’s suggestions to find their solution. To know about different types of learners follow the post “Different Learning Styles”.
           <br> (7) “No exam fever” encourages deep approach of learning against the surface & strategic approach of learning.To know more about different approach of learning follow the post “Different strategies of learning”.
            <br>(8) Peer evaluation provides the opportunity to learn via grading others. Because it is the best way to learn when you teach or grade someone else.
            <br>(9) MOOC provides the opportunity to learn from world class universities and from renowned instructors without being a student of the respective university while sitting in the any part of the world.
           <br> (10) MOOC opens up the facility to get free of cost “statement of accomplishment” signed by the instructor of the course, which someone completes in all respect according to the requirement of the subject. There are provision to earn the verified certificates with university logo and instructor signature on the payment of the course fee. Anyone can show these certificates at the time of job applications also. The employer can go to the corresponding MOOC provider database to get the information regarding the candidate. Some universities also started allowing to fulfill credit requirements of a degree from the MOOC courses
