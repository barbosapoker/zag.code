           <p>term originated in the US in 2008 to describe free, easily accessible, completely online courses. MOOCs give you the chance to study with top universities around the world.
            MOOCs don’t always lead to formal qualifications, but they do mean you can gain knowledge in all sorts of areas. You might use a MOOC to  develop career skills, prepare for other education, or explore a new interest.
            There are usually no entry requirements for MOOCs. You can take part regardless of where you live or your financial circumstances. Because they take place online, MOOCs can grow very big. You might find yourself learning with thousands of other people – they don’t call them massive for nothing.</p>
